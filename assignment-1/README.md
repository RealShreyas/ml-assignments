# Regression Tree

This is an an implementation of regression tree using the inbuilt library in sci-kit learn.

# Dependencies

- *Numpy*
- *Pandas*
- *Sklearn*
- *Matplotlib*

# How to run

###### The file main.py contains the code for training the tree by performing an 80/20 split on the dataset and running 10 times and printing the average accuracy. This also prints the plots of accuracy vs depth and accuracy vs error. The pruning of tree is also done to find the regression tree which is more accurate. This contains the plot of accuracy vs alpha which is the statistic that determines the branch to be pruned.

###### The file decision_tree.py contains the implementation of the decision tree from scratch.
